## Quick Guide to Creating a Mind-Map

When the application is first launched, a main idea node will be displayed in the center of the mind-map canvas. The following actions can be performed on this node:

1. **'e' key**: Edits the displayed node text (otherwise called the node "name") of the currently selected node. Editable text will be immediately highlighted, so just start typing the new name to change it. To end the text editing, hit either the **Return** key or the **Tab** key.

2. **Tab**: Adds a new child node to the currently selected node. The new node will be immediately editable.

3. **Return**: Adds a new sibling node of the currently selected node. The new node will be immediately editable.

4. **Right mouse click**: Displays a contextual menu listing the available actions that can be taken.


## Property Sidebar

The property sidebar can be shown or hidden by clicking on the gear icon in the upper right corner of the window. This sidebar contains two tabs, one for editing or taking action on the currently selected node. The other tab allows you to modify the layout or theme that is used for the entire mind map.
